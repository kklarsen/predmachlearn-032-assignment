# predmachlearn-032-assignment

Find the detailed project requirements at the following Coursera page [Project Assignment for Coursera Practical Machine Learning (no. 32).](https://class.coursera.org/predmachlearn-032/human_grading/view/courses/975201/assessments/4/submissions). This also includes links to the training and testing datasets.

##SYNOPSIS

**The goal of this analysis is to create a machine learning model using a set of activity monitors (or measurements) that recoognize the quality in execution of lifting a barbell. The datasets used in this analysis have kindly been provided by Velloso et all. The training dataset, used in the model development, consist of 143 activity monitors, or type of measurements characterizing the execution of lifting a barbell, that fully charecterizes the barbell lift. While several algorithm from the `caret` package have been used, only Random Forest with Cross-Validation `cv` and 10 k-folds will be presented in this paper. The resulting random forest model have an accuracy of 98.52% for an optimal `mtry` of 27 (out of 52 features) and will predict all the 20 test cases provided.**
